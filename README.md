# Seq-NMS
I realize the method Seq-NMS mentioned in paper: SEQ-NMS FOR VIDEO OBJECT DETECTION based on the Faster-RCNN.

Without a good computer to train a network, I use the demo program and pre-trained network given by Faster-RCNN to do the detection in each frame in a video.

If you want to use it, follow the demo instruction given by [Faster-RCNN](https://github.com/smallcorgi/Faster-RCNN_TF), and replace the demo.py file by the video.py given here.

PS: It will be very very slow to detect a video...
