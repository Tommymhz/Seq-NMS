# Implementation of Seq-NMS
> Only used for self-learning

I implement the method Seq-NMS mentioned in paper: SEQ-NMS FOR VIDEO OBJECT DETECTION based on the Faster-RCNN.

As for the detection in a single frame, I use the demo program and pre-trained network given by Faster-RCNN to run the detection in each frame in a video.

Follow the demo instruction given by [Faster-RCNN](https://github.com/smallcorgi/Faster-RCNN_TF), and replace the demo.py file by the seqnms.py given here.
